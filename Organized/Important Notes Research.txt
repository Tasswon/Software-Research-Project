Community is an indirect metric that correlates to success
- mention that research suggests including one example of each type...

Mention that I have an idea for open source projects, but haven't completed them yet as I 
wanted confirmation that what I've done so far is acceptable.

Note: Mention that you want to test the project on four open source projects of relatively 
similar sizes, and that utlize the same code paradigm. You have realized that multiple testing
tools can't be used as they have variation on results, however we'll run the tests a few times
to ensure validation. Also, we should use two OSS projects with lower reviews, and two with higher
reviews as this generally correponds to quality based on suggested research.

May want some type of test to check for errors

First part of the test was to ensure the products work as intended and utilize the same computer
system to ensure results are within scientific markers

Modeling vs categorization

mention that you seperate articles by category and extrated the info by highlighting and making notes

mention use of metrics at different stages, by different people (QA metrics article)

no metrics appear to have a standardized number

OSS doesn't reduce quality or create more bugs, therefore can use standard metrics in some cases

Metrics: list from article (recommendations), comments, Maintainability Index, Errors (also use categorization
mentioned in the models), documentation

**When you email Simon explain that some are not in the summaries as they are either supplementary or
were discovered during the creation of the literature review

**We take the point that many metrics either measure the same thing or aren't a true measure of quality
(you only need a few to get a generalized perspective)
- purpose is that we're concentrating on the big picture

**get quality definition from ISO website
**get OSS definition from somewhere else

**check numbers for metrics (what is a standard and perhaps weighted average like in SQO-OSS)

***eliminated some articles as they weren't relevant as I once thought or had too much repetition

***consider the concept of doing more with less
